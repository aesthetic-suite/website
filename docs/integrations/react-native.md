The React Native integration provides a bridge between Aesthetic core and
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) itself. It enables components to easily and fluently style
themselves with design tokens compiled by a design system.

- [Getting started](./react-native/setup.mdx)
- [Using themes](./react-native/themes.mdx)
- [Directionality](./react-native/direction.mdx)
- [API](./react-native/api.md)

Same as React:

- [Styling components](./react/styles.mdx)
- [Styled components](./react/styled.mdx)

## Features

- Styled component, Hook, and HOC based APIs for styling, accessing themes, and handling
  directionality.
- Element level style sheets and nested themes.
- First-class directionality support (RTL, LTR).

## Requirements

- React 17+
- React Native 0.64+
