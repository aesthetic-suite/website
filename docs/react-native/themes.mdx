To provide the active theme to all React components, we'll need to render a `ThemeProvider` at the
root of your application. By default, the active theme will automatically be detected based on a
user's preference, like preferred color scheme, contrast levels, and more!

```tsx title="index.ts" {3,9-11}
import React from 'react';
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@aesthetic/react-native';
import './setup';
import App from './App';

function Root() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <App />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
);

AppRegistry.registerComponent('Root', () => Root);
```

> Only 1 `ThemeProvider` may be rendered in an application.

## Changing themes

As mentioned in the primary themes documentation, a theme can be changed with the `changeTheme()`
method. When called, this method will trigger a re-render on the root `ThemeProvider`.

However, there is a secondary approach for changing themes, and that is through the `name` prop.
This approach is a bit cumbersome, as it requires re-rendering the provider near the root of the
application, which requires some form of state at that layer.

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@aesthetic/react-native';

<ThemeProvider name="twilight">
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>;
```

## Contextual themeing

A root `ThemeProvider` provides design tokens to the entire application through React context, with
the active theme being automatically detected based on the device and environment (unless `name` is
explicitly passed).

To theme a specific section of the React tree, a `ContextualThemeProvider` can be rendered with an
explicit theme name.

```tsx
import { View } from 'react-native';
import { ThemeProvider, ContextualThemeProvider } from '@aesthetic/react-native';

<ThemeProvider name="day">
  <View>Inherits styles from the day theme.</View>

  <ContextualThemeProvider name="night">
    <View>Inherits styles from the night theme.</View>
  </ContextualThemeProvider>
</ThemeProvider>;
```

> `ContextualThemeProvider`s can be infinitely nested, but not recommended.

## Accessing the theme

To manually access the provided `Theme` object, either from the root or contextually, use the
`useTheme()` hook or `withTheme()` HOC.

<Tabs
  groupId="api-type"
  defaultValue="hook"
  values={[
    { label: 'Hook', value: 'hook' },
    { label: 'HOC', value: 'hoc' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="hook">

```tsx {4,6}
import { useTheme } from '@aesthetic/react-native';

export default function Component() {
  const theme = useTheme();

  if (theme.scheme === 'dark') {
    // Do something
  }

  return <div />;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="hoc">

```tsx {3,4,11}
import { withTheme, WithThemeWrappedProps } from '@aesthetic/react-native';

function Component({ theme }: WithThemeWrappedProps) {
  if (theme.contrast === 'high') {
    // Do something
  }

  return <div />;
}

export default withTheme()(Component);
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
