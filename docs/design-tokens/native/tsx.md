The following [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) format is provided when compiling design
tokens for advanced solutions, like CSS-in-JS. It currently supports 2 different targets:

- `native-tsx` for TypeScript.
- `native-jsx` for JavaScript (using ECMA modules).

This format is based on the [web-jsx/tsx](../web/tsx) format, with the same differences described in
the [native-js/ts](./ts) format.

> Please refer to the [web based format](../web/ts) for more information on how to use this format.
