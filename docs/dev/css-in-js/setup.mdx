import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

Firstly, the CSS-in-JS solution requires compiling your [design system](../../design-system.md) into
expanded [design tokens](../../design-tokens/web/tsx.md) with either the `web-tsx`, `web-jsx`,
`native-tsx`, or `native-jsx` formats.

Next you'll need to install an [integration](../../integrations.md) of your choice.

<Tabs
  groupId="package-manager"
  defaultValue="yarn"
  values={[
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn' },
    { label: 'NPM', value: 'npm' },
  ]}
>
  <TabItem value="yarn">

```bash
yarn add @aesthetic/<integration>
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash
npm install @aesthetic/<integration>
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Lastly, create a setup file for Aesthetic based configuration, typically within your project source.
We'll name ours `setup.ts` going forward.

```bash
touch setup.ts
```

## Preface

In this documentation, you'll come across code examples that import from `@aesthetic/<integration>`.
This module _should_ be replaced with your integration of choice. For example, if you're using
React, you should import from `@aesthetic/react` instead.
