The React integration provides a bridge between Aesthetic core and [React](https://reactjs.org/)
itself. It enables components to easily and fluently style themselves with design tokens compiled by
a design system.

- [Getting started](./react/setup.mdx)
- [Using themes](./react/themes.mdx)
- [Styling components](./react/styles.mdx)
- [Styled components](./react/styled.mdx)

  directionality.
- Global, document, and element level styles powered through context.
- Nested themes that avoid polluting the global scope.
