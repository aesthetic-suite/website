The `@aesthetic/sss` package, also known as structured style sheets or SSS, is a strict, type-safe,
and structure-safe CSS-in-JS style sheet format. It's a specification that provides a global style
sheet for handling document level styles, and a local style sheet for handling isolated element and
component styles.
